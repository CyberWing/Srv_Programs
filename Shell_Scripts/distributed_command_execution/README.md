# Distributed Command Execution Script

This script to use when you need to execute a command through out the servers in the list.
You can add servers, delete servers and list the servers located in targetservers.txt.
And you can also execute a command to all the servers in the list.

# THIS SCRIPT WORKS BETTER IF

You have public key authentication on all servers in the list!
